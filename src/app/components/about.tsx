            <p>Hi, I am a graduate of Manisa Celal Bayar University 
            Software Engineering. Currently, I am studying for a
            Master's Degree in Software Engineering at Manisa Celal
            Bayar University. I work as a Full-Stack Developer at Supply 
            Chain Wizard. I am interested in new technologies. I am trying 
            to improve myself with the courses I follow from online course 
            sites and with the software technology books I read. I am trying 
            to develop projects and write medium articles with my new knowledge
            that I have learned.</p>
